# CodeAlpha-Intership-Projects
This repository contains tasks and projects completed during my one month internship at CodeAlpha, focusing on front-end development in HTML,CSS and Javascript.
### TASK 1: Build a Calculator
---
### *OBJECTIVE*: 
The objective of this project is to design and implement a calculator with a theme-switching feature (dark and light modes) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides functionalities such as resetting input, deleting characters, and evaluating mathematical expressions. The theme switcher allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, enhancing the user experience by offering visual flexibility.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
  - The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, displaying results in real-time.
  - It features a responsive and user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and additional functions like reset, delete, and parentheses.
  - The theme-switching functionality enables users to toggle between light and dark modes, providing a visually appealing experience that adapts to different lighting conditions.
  - Input validation is incorporated to handle empty or incorrect expressions, showing error messages when necessary and ensuring smooth operation.
+ *KEY STEPS* :
  - Design the calculator layout using HTML, including buttons for numbers, operators, and special functions like reset and delete.
  - Style the calculator using CSS, applying both light and dark theme designs, and ensure the layout is responsive and visually appealing.
  - Implement basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript, using event listeners on buttons to handle user input and updating the display with real-time calculations.
  - Add error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases like empty or incorrect expressions, ensuring a smooth user experience.
  - Enable theme switching functionality, allowing users to toggle between dark and light modes with a button click, and dynamically update the interface styling accordingly.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*: HTML,CSS,Javascript
+ *OUTCOME*: Functional calculator with a responsive interface, supporting basic arithmetic operations and theme-switching between dark and light modes, enhancing both usability and visual appeal.
+ *FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS*: In the future, this calculator can be expanded to include advanced mathematical functions, such as trigonometric and logarithmic calculations, as well as features like history tracking, memory functions, and customizable themes, further enhancing its usability and versatility for users.

### TASK 2: Image Gallery
---
### *OBJECTIVE*: 
Create an interactive image gallery where images expand upon clicking, providing a visually engaging user experience.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
  - The gallery contains multiple panels, each displaying a background image and a title for different locations.
  - Upon clicking a panel, it expands, while others shrink, ensuring only one panel is prominent at a time.
  - The system is responsive, hiding some images on smaller screens for optimized viewing. 
  - JavaScript enables click functionality, controlling which panel expands and collapses.
+ *KEY STEPS* :
  - Structure the HTML layout with div elements for each panel.
  - Style panels using CSS for background images, text, and responsiveness.
  - Implement a flex-based layout that dynamically adjusts the panel sizes.
  - Add JavaScript to manage click events, expanding and collapsing panels.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*: HTML,CSS,Javascript
+ *OUTCOME*: Gallery offering a seamless, intuitive user interface that enhances image display. 
+ *FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS*: In the future, gallery can integrate lazy loading for images, add a full-screen viewing option, or include dynamic image content fetched from a server or API to make the gallery more interactive and scalable.

### TASK 3: Music Player
---
### *OBJECTIVE*: 
Develop a stylish music player that allows users to play, pause, navigate between songs, control volume, and track progress dynamically with visually appealing album art.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
  - Load songs dynamically with corresponding album covers.
  - Control song playback with play/pause, next, and previous buttons.
  - Display and update song duration and progress in real-time.
  - Volume control integrated for a smooth user experience.
+ *KEY STEPS* :
  - Dynamic album art and song details.
  - Play, pause, next, and previous song functionalities.
  - Real-time progress and volume control.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*: HTML,CSS,Javascript
+ *OUTCOME*: A functional and visually engaging music player that enhances user interaction.
+ *FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS*:
   - Playlist support and shuffle functionality.
   - Additional audio effects like equalizer or repeat mode.
   - Integration with popular music streaming APIs (e.g., Spotify).

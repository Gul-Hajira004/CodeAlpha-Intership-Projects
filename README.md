# CodeAlpha-Intership-Projects
This repository contains tasks and projects completed during my one month internship at CodeAlpha, focusing on front-end development in HTML,CSS and Javascript.
### TASK 1: Build a Calculator
---
### *OBJECTIVE*: 
The objective of this project is to design and implement a calculator with a theme-switching feature (dark and light modes) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides functionalities such as resetting input, deleting characters, and evaluating mathematical expressions. The theme switcher allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, enhancing the user experience by offering visual flexibility.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
  - The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, displaying results in real-time.
  - It features a responsive and user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and additional functions like reset, delete, and parentheses.
  - The theme-switching functionality enables users to toggle between light and dark modes, providing a visually appealing experience that adapts to different lighting conditions.
  - Input validation is incorporated to handle empty or incorrect expressions, showing error messages when necessary and ensuring smooth operation.
+ *KEY STEPS* :
  - Design the calculator layout using HTML, including buttons for numbers, operators, and special functions like reset and delete.
  - Style the calculator using CSS, applying both light and dark theme designs, and ensure the layout is responsive and visually appealing.
  - Implement basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript, using event listeners on buttons to handle user input and updating the display with real-time calculations.
  - Add error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases like empty or incorrect expressions, ensuring a smooth user experience.
  - Enable theme switching functionality, allowing users to toggle between dark and light modes with a button click, and dynamically update the interface styling accordingly.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*: HTML,CSS,Javascript
+ *OUTCOME*: Functional calculator with a responsive interface, supporting basic arithmetic operations and theme-switching between dark and light modes, enhancing both usability and visual appeal.
+ *FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS*: In the future, this calculator can be expanded to include advanced mathematical functions, such as trigonometric and logarithmic calculations, as well as features like history tracking, memory functions, and customizable themes, further enhancing its usability and versatility for users.
